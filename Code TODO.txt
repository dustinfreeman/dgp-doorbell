BUGFIXES

- Fix problem where people walking to the door get control of the system briefly.
  - maybe only when people stop & stand still can they control it?
- Fix head cropping problem...somehow. Either changes people's behaviour or change the system.
- Add "blank" emails at the beginning and the end. Zhao complains that he gets excessive emails.
- Fix issue of not being able to scroll completely to left

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT IDEAS

-Instead of emailing faculty, it shows a map to their offices. Also, show internal maps to people's desks.
-Flip image so it's not mirrored of reality
