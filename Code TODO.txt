To Do - May 18th
----------------------
EMAIL INTERFACE to dgpdoorbell@dgp.toronto.edu
Subject lines:
add me/remove me - add your email to the list
add study/remove study - add a study notification with your email to the doorbell
message - puts a message on the doorbell, leaves it for 15 minutes
(replying to the email you get from the doorbell also puts the message on the doorbell)

Physical:
- Door sensor (open/close) <Jon>
- Floor mat <Frank>
- Arduino - interface between sensors & computer <Frank & Sen>

BUGFIXES
- Program crashed - possibly due to memory issues as log file >500M
  - break logs into monthly files
  - add error trapping and logging
  
MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- position of person must stop for 500 ms before they receive control (must show progress) (fill up vertical)
- Take Picture "for Fun" Stuff.
- Jon: suggests it should restart into the proper mode when the computer does (mostly does now, except for fullscreen issue).  Note that this needs to be optional to enable debugging sessions.
- Heartbeat feature so we know it's running
- Dynamic reloading of names (and settings?) if underlying files change
- Meta todo: switch todo list items to actual bug tracker issues
- by first name and last name
- customizable email addresses
- analyse logs to look for trends (when is it most used, how often do people walk by, how many people usually use it, etc.)
- Add clock to doorbell screen/screen saver
- Add intelligent handling of long names (e.g., reduce font size). Right now we just truncate names.



FUTURE IMPROVEMENT IDEAS

- Instead of emailing faculty, it shows a map to their offices. Also, show internal Map to people's desks.
- Other notifications, e.g., SMS, phone call, IM, Jabber, etc
- Logging interaction timings/events
- Announcements/Ticker/Classes/Studies
- Screen saver (fun DGP images)
- reply back / personal state (I'm here, I'm not here, etc.)
- Door open/close tracking
- Desk indicator (possible notification response)
- Redesign of interface (for shorter people)
