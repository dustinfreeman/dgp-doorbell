To Do - Friday Dec 9th
----------------------
Code:

- Get rid of CurrentEmailVisual framework 
 


- position of person must stop for 500 ms before they receive control (must show progress) (fill up vertical)
 
- List of names wraps (so A follows Z) <Dustin>
- Fix issue of not being able to scroll completely to left <Dustin>
- Left/Right: Starts scrolling slow and ramps up.

- Make it run in "Exclusive" Mode (Frank) like a game. Hides Windows Update notifications, etc. (debug mode vs "normal") <Frank>

- Take Picture "for Fun" Stuff.

- PictureOptions timeout - 10 s?

- Flip image so it's not mirrored of reality <Dustin>

- Logging on all buttons.


Heartbeat Monitoring:
- icon showing "last email failed"

Logging:
- Talk about log format <Rorik>
- backup
- interaction start
- scroll left/right
- magnitude of scroll
- hover over widgets
- email triggered

Physical:
- Door sensor (open/close) <Jon>
- Floor mat <Frank>
- Arduino - interface between sensors & computer <Frank & Sen>


BUGFIXES

- Fix problem where people walking to the door get control of the system briefly.
  - maybe only when people stop & stand still can they control it?
- Add "blank" emails at the beginning and the end. Zhao complains that he gets excessive emails.
- Better error handling if (private or public) settings files missing

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- Jon: suggests it should restart into the proper mode when the computer does (mostly does now, except for fullscreen issue).  Note that this needs to be optional to enable debugging sessions.
- Heartbeat feature so we know it's running
- Dynamic reloading of names (and settings?) if underlying files change
- Meta todo: switch todo list items to actual bug tracker issues
- by first name and last name
- customizable email addresses


FUTURE IMPROVEMENT IDEAS

- Instead of emailing faculty, it shows a map to their offices. Also, show internal maps to people's desks.
- Other notifications, e.g., SMS, phone call, IM, etc
- Logging interaction timings/events
- Announcements/Ticker/Classes/Studies
- Screen saver 
- map
- reply back / personal state (I'm here, I'm not here, etc.)
- Door open/close tracking
