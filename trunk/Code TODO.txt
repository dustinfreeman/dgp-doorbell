----------------------
Code:
<<<<<<< .mine
=======

- Debug.

>>>>>>> .r95
- position of person must stop for 500 ms before they receive control (must show progress) (fill up vertical)

- Door sensor (open/close) <Jon>

BUGFIXES

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
- Take Picture "for Fun" Stuff.
- Jon: suggests it should restart into the proper mode when the computer does (mostly does now, except for fullscreen issue).  Note that this needs to be optional to enable debugging sessions.
- Heartbeat feature so we know it's running
- Dynamic reloading of names (and settings?) if underlying files change
- Meta todo: switch todo list items to actual bug tracker issues
- by first name and last name
- customizable email addresses


FUTURE IMPROVEMENT IDEAS

- Instead of emailing faculty, it shows a map to their offices. Also, show internal maps to people's desks.
- Other notifications, e.g., SMS, phone call, IM, etc
- Logging interaction timings/events
- Announcements/Ticker/Classes/Studies
- Screen saver 
- map
- reply back / personal state (I'm here, I'm not here, etc.)
- Door open/close tracking
