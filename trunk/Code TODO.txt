BUGFIXES

- Fix problem where people walking to the door get control of the system briefly.
  - maybe only when people stop & stand still can they control it?
- Fix head cropping problem...somehow. Either changes people's behaviour or change the system.
- Add "blank" emails at the beginning and the end. Zhao complains that he gets excessive emails.
- Fix issue of not being able to scroll completely to left
- More name cleanups (e.g., corrections for multiword last names)
- Better error handling if (private or public) settings files missing

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

- Make it run in "Exclusive" Mode (Frank) like a game. Hides Windows Update notifications, etc.
- Jon: suggests it should restart into the proper mode when the computer does (mostly does now, except for fullscreen issue).  Note that this needs to be optional to enable debugging sessions.
- Heartbeat feature so we know it's running
- List of names wraps (so A follows Z)
- Dynamic reloading of names (and settings?) if underlying files change
- Camera "flash" animation for taking of picture, show a preview, maybe option to retake photo?
- Meta todo: switch todo list items to actual bug tracker issues


FUTURE IMPROVEMENT IDEAS

-Instead of emailing faculty, it shows a map to their offices. Also, show internal maps to people's desks.
-Flip image so it's not mirrored of reality
-Other notifications, e.g., SMS, phone call, IM, etc
